# ONGC HR Applicant Tracking System (ATS)

An **HR-based Applicant Tracking System** developed exclusively for **ONGC** to streamline recruitment and applicant management.  
The system shifts traditional **Excel-based database processing** into a **structured, digital HR platform** with improved efficiency, scalability, and data consistency.

## 📖 How It Works
1. HR/Admin logs in with role-based credentials.  
2. Applicants are imported in bulk from the Google form.  
3. Recruiters can update applicant progress through hiring stages.  
4. The system generates structured reports and analytics for HR review.
